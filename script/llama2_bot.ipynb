      "Endorsements[edit]\n",
      "As of March 2023[update], Ohtani endorsement earnings were estimated to be a MLB league-leading $35–40 million for the 2023 year, up from his MLB league-leading $20 million endorsement earnings in 2022, which tripled from his MLB league-leading $6 million endorsement earnings in 2021.[202][203] Ohtani has proven to be a marketing hit on both sides of the Pacific, with a group of 13 partnerships that includes New Balance, Fanatics, Topps[204] and Panini[204] in the U.S. and Hugo Boss, Kosé, Porsche Japan, Kowa, Mitsubishi Bank, Japan Airlines, Salesforce, Nishikawa Co., and Seiko Watch in Japan.[205]\n",
      "In 2023, Ohtani added two new deals with New Balance[206]  and Japanese cosmetics company Kosé.[207] Ohtani signed a multi-year footwear and apparel endorsement deal with New Balance and wears their gear on the field. Ohtani had previously worn exclusive Asics gear on the field, before making the transition to New Balance,[206] while Kosé announced Ohtani would appear in campaigns throughout the US during the 2023 baseball season promoting skincare products such as lotion and sun care from its brands Decorté and Sekkisei, as the new global ambassador for the company.[207]\n",
      "In 2022, Ohtani became a brand ambassador for Kowa, Mitsubishi Bank, Japan Airlines, Salesforce,[205] and Porsche Japan as part of their 'Porsche Driving Athlete' family.[208]\n",
      "Ohtani is the cover athlete of MLB The Show 22[209] and is the first Asian player to be featured as the cover star of the US edition of MLB: The Show.[210] On February 9, 2022, Ohtani appeared in the Nintendo Direct to promote MLB The Show 22, as it was the first installment in the franchise to appear on a Nintendo console. In the direct, two versions of Ohtani, one in hitting gear, the other in pitching gear, stood side by side holding devices. The use of Ohtani to promote it was seen as tied to his Japanese nationality, as Nintendo is based in Japan.[211]\n",
      "On July 20, 2021, Ohtani signed an exclusive multiyear memorabilia deal with Fanatics.[212]\n",
      "Ohtani's previous partnerships included Asics, Descente, Oakley, New Era, FTX, Savas, and Aquarius.[213] On November 16, 2021, it was announced that Ohtani joined cryptocurrency exchange FTX as a global ambassador,[214] partnering on various animal charitable initiatives;[215] however, in November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds. Ohtani, alongside other spokespeople, is currently being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit[216][217] with the athlete's lawyers filing for Ohtani's dismissal from the FTX lawsuit in April 2023.[218]\n",

      "Ohtani made his debut at age 18 in the Fighters' season-opening game on March 29, 2013, playing as a right fielder.[32] He was selected for a Pacific League roster spot for the 2013 All-star game. As a pitcher, he finished the season with a 3–0 record in 11 starts. As a rookie Ohtani was used in both the outfield (leading the Fighters with 51 games in right) and as a pitcher.[33] He was the second Nippon Pro Baseball rookie drafted out of high school the previous year to be used as both a pitcher and position player, following Kikuo Tokunaga in 1951; Ohtani was the first to start in both roles. He was the first NPB pitcher since Takao Kajimoto in 1963 to bat 3rd, 4th, or 5th and the first rookie hurler to do so since Junzo Sekine in 1950. He was the second player, following Osamu Takechi (also 1950), to start a game as a pitcher, bat in the heart of the order (3rd through 5th), and get a hit and a run batted in (RBI) in that game. He missed time during the year with a right ankle sprain and right cheekbone fracture.\n",
      "For the season, he was 3–0 with a 4.23 ERA, 33 walks, and 46 strikeouts in 61+2⁄3 innings. and hit .238/.284/.376 in 204 plate appearances.[2] He had seven outfield assists to one error. His 8 hit batsmen tied Manabu Mima, Tadashi Settsu, Hideaki Wakui and Ryoma Nogami for 5th in the 2013 Pacific League. Ohtani received 4 of the 233 votes for the 2013 Nippon Professional Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (Pacific League), tying Tatsuya Sato for a distant second behind Takahiro Norimoto.[34] During his five-year tenure with the Fighters, Ohtani opted to live in the team's provided dormitories, while his parents oversaw his finances.[18]\n",

Ohtani had previously worn exclusive Asics gear on the field, before making the transition to New Balance,[206] while Kosé announced Ohtani would appear in campaigns throughout the US during the 2023 baseball season promoting skincare products such as lotion and sun care from its brands Decorté and Sekkisei, as the new global ambassador for the company.[207]\\nIn 2022, Ohtani became a brand ambassador for Kowa, Mitsubishi Bank, Japan Airlines, Salesforce,[205] and Porsche Japan as part of their \\'Porsche Driving Athlete\\' family.[208]\\nOhtani is the cover athlete of MLB The Show 22[209] and is the first Asian player to be featured as the cover star of the US edition of MLB: The Show.[210] On February 9, 2022, Ohtani appeared in the Nintendo Direct to promote MLB The Show 22, as it was the first installment in the franchise to appear on a Nintendo console. In the direct, two versions of Ohtani, one in hitting gear, the other in pitching gear, stood side by side holding devices. The use of Ohtani to promote it was seen as tied to his Japanese nationality, as Nintendo is based in Japan.[211]\\nOn July 20, 2021, Ohtani signed an exclusive multiyear memorabilia deal with Fanatics.[212]\\nOhtani\\'s previous partnerships included Asics, Descente, Oakley, New Era, FTX, Savas, and Aquarius.[213] On November 16, 2021, it was announced that Ohtani joined cryptocurrency exchange FTX as a global ambassador,[214] partnering on various animal charitable initiatives;[215] however, in November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds. Ohtani, alongside other spokespeople, is currently being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit[216][217] with the athlete\\'s lawyers filing for Ohtani\\'s dismissal from the FTX lawsuit in April 2023.[218]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\nJapan portalBaseball portal\\n\\nList of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders\\nList of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders\\nList of Major League Baseball players from Japan\\nMajor League Baseball Player of the Week Award\\nMajor League Baseball Rookie of the Month Award\\nMajor League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award\\nSporting News Rookie of the Year Award\\nList of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle\\nList of Major League Baseball players from Japan\\nAll MLB Team\\n\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ \"Shohei Otani named WBSC player of the year for 2015\".

As a pitcher, he finished the season with a 3–0 record in 11 starts. As a rookie Ohtani was used in both the outfield (leading the Fighters with 51 games in right) and as a pitcher.[33] He was the second Nippon Pro Baseball rookie drafted out of high school the previous year to be used as both a pitcher and position player, following Kikuo Tokunaga in 1951; Ohtani was the first to start in both roles. He was the first NPB pitcher since Takao Kajimoto in 1963 to bat 3rd, 4th, or 5th and the first rookie hurler to do so since Junzo Sekine in 1950. He was the second player, following Osamu Takechi (also 1950), to start a game as a pitcher, bat in the heart of the order (3rd through 5th), and get a hit and a run batted in (RBI) in that game. He missed time during the year with a right ankle sprain and right cheekbone fracture.\\nFor the season, he was 3–0 with a 4.23 ERA, 33 walks, and 46 strikeouts in 61+2⁄3 innings. and hit .238/.284/.376 in 204 plate appearances.[2] He had seven outfield assists to one error. His 8 hit batsmen tied Manabu Mima, Tadashi Settsu, Hideaki Wakui and Ryoma Nogami for 5th in the 2013 Pacific League. Ohtani received 4 of the 233 votes for the 2013 Nippon Professional Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (Pacific League), tying Tatsuya Sato for a distant second behind Takahiro Norimoto.[34] During his five-year tenure with the Fighters, Ohtani opted to live in the team\\'s provided dormitories, while his parents oversaw his finances.[18] \\n\\n ^ \"Angels News: Is Shohei Ohtani Having the Greatest Single Season Ever?\".
